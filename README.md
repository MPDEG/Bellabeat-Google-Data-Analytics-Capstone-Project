The case study follows the six step data analysis process:

Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act.

## Scenario 

Working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analysing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyse smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. 


Sršen asks you to analyse smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. She then wants you to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation. 

These questions will guide your analysis: 
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?


### The Business Task
With all the information we have the business task is to analyse data from non-Bellabeat smart devices to see how the consumers are using it and with the insights found in that data apply it to a Bellabeat’s product to help the marketing team to find a strategy for the company.

The analysis and recommendations will be presented to the Bellabeat executive team and Marketing team.
